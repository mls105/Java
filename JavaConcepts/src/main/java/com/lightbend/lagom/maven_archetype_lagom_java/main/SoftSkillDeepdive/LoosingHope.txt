Why programmers lose hope:

Forced to cut corners - estimates are bad (unit testing, rushed design, hacky code)
Cognative overload - coding is already hard.. adding extra processes (meetings, time tracker)  doesn't help
low perception of value - trivializing the work done
learned helpless - negativity on the team can really do damage
push back on unreasonable requests
communicate uncertainty - we can't predict everything. stop agreeing to work/deadline without enough information
ask for help earlier - level of experience doesn't matter. check ego
