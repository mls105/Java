//Linked List:
//- inserting or removing a value is VERY fast!
//
//Array List:
//-getting a value is very fast
//
//tiny list doesn't really matter!
//if the list is static and doesn't change much and you are just retrieving values then use an array list
//if the list doesnt need to be retrieved often but you are adding a lot then use a linked list
