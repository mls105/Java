Agile:
Continuously deliver value! Why?? - Customers want something but it takes so long to build that by the time they get it it's taken too long and is wrong.
Need feedback from customer and act on it asap


How to spot fake agile:
How do we gather feedback? Every time we do a release we get info from customer/tester
How do we plan for feedback changes?
