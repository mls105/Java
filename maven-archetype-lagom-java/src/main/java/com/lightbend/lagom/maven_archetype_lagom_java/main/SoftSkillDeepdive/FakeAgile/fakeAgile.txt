Agile:
Continuously deliver value! Why?? - Customers want something but it takes so long to build that by the time they get it it's taken too long and is wrong.
Need feedback from customer and act on it asap


How to spot fake agile:
How do we gather feedback? Every time we do a release we get info from customer/tester
Do we plan for feedback changes?



Why programmers hate Scrum:
1) PO shouldnt be in DSU
2) overstepping SM when they aren't technical
3) obsession with features 
4) story points treated as time
5) refusal to cancel sprint
6) No acceptance criteria (scope can really blow up as you go down edge cases) 
7) burn down chart used to blame
